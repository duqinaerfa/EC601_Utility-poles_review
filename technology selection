Google vision API:
Google Photos relies on pattern matching algorithms and image classification. This is the technology which makes it possible for us to search for photos containing a particular landmark or object. 
By open sourcing Cloud Vision, Google allows developers to take advantage of Googleâ€™s underlying image recognition technology to build applications which see and understand content within its images. 
Cloud Vision API enables your developers to build image recognition and classification features into your application, by incorporating image analytics capabilities in the form of easy to use REST APIs.
